# C++ Currency Converter

## About
The is a C++ based currency conversion project that uses some basic language concepts to deliver an easy to use program.
Some main concepts used in the program are listed below:
- Arrays,
- JSON data structure: JSON is an object or array of objects. This data structure helps to store all currency rates in a file and makes it easy to access the values to perform conversions,
- For/while loops,
- Functions,
- Recursive functions: Used to recursively get inputs from the user until a condition is met and the program can continue processing the next statement,
- Objects and Classes,
- IO Manipulator functions: Used for formatting the console screen into an easy to read format i.e. setw() function,
- File handling: Used to store and access data in .txt and .json files,
- Try/catch: For error handling

## Technologies
- C++
